üèÅ Log of recent changes
-----------------------

_Version 1.3.0_: `eprints2bags` now generates uncompressed [ZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) archives of bags by default, instead of using compressed [tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) format.  This was done in the belief that ZIP format is more widely supported and because compressed archive file contents may be more difficult to recover if the archive file becomes corrupted.  Also, `eprints2bags` now uses the run-time environment's keychain/keyring services to store the user name and password between runs, for convenience when running the program repeatedly.  Finally, some of the the command-line options have been changed.

‚òÄ Introduction
-----------------------------

Materials in EPrints must be extracted before they can be moved to a preservation system such as [DPN](https://dpn.org) or another long-term storage or dark archive.  _Eprints2bags_ encapsulates the processes needed to gather the materials and bundle them up in [BagIt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt) packages.  The program works over a network using an EPrints server's REST API.  It downloads a subset of records or all records, and bags them up individually.  Eprints2bags is a command-line tool written in Python 3.


‚ú∫ Installation instructions
---------------------------

The following is probably the simplest and most direct way to install this software on your computer, as well as update an existing copy if you have already installed eprints2bags and a new version has been released:
```sh
sudo python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprints2bags.git --upgrade
```

Alternatively, you can instead clone this GitHub repository and then run `setup.py` manually.  First, create a directory somewhere on your computer where you want to store the files, and cd to it from a terminal shell.  Next, execute the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprints2bags.git
cd eprints2bags
sudo python3 -m pip install . --upgrade
```

On Linux and macOS systems, assuming that the installation proceeds normally, you should end up with a program called `eprints2bags` in a location normally searched by your terminal shell for commands.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é Running eprints2bags
---------------------

This program contacts an EPrints REST server whose network API is accessible at the URL given by the command-line option `-a` (or `/a` on Windows).  A typical EPrints server URL has the form `https://server.institution.edu/rest`.  The `-a` (or `/a`) option is required; the program cannot infer the server address on its own.

The EPrints records to be written will be limited to the list of EPrints numbers found in the file given by the option `-i` (or `/i` on Windows).  If no `-i` option is given, this program will download all the contents available at the given EPrints server.  The value of `-i` can also be one or more integers separated by commas (e.g., `-i 54602,54604`), or a range of numbers separated by a dash (e.g., `-i 1-100`, which is interpreted as the list of numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 inclusive), or some combination thereof.  In those cases, the records written will be limited to those numbered.

By default, if a record requested or implied by the arguments to `-i` is missing from the EPrints server, this **will count as an error** and stop execution of the program.  If the option `-m` (or `/m` on Windows) is given, missing records will be ignored instead.  Option `-m` is particularly useful when giving a range of numbers with the `-i` option, as it is common for EPrints records to be updated or deleted and gaps to be left in the numbering.

This program writes the output in the directory given by the command-line option `-o` (or `/o` on Windows).  If the directory does not exist, this program will create it.  If the directory does exist, it will be overwritten with the new contents.  The result of running this program will be individual directories underneath the directory given by the `-o` option, with each subdirectory named according to the EPrints record number (e.g., `/path/to/output/430`, `/path/to/output/431`, `/path/to/output/432`, ...).  If the `-b` option (`/b` on Windows) is given, the subdirectory names are changed to have the form _BASENAME-NUMBER_ where _BASENAME_ is the text string provided with the `-b` option and the _NUMBER_ is the EPrints number for a given entry.


### Contents gathered and output produced

Each directory created by `eprints2bags` will contain an EP3XML XML file and additional document file(s) associated with the EPrints record in question.  The list of documents for each record is determined from XML file, in the `<documents>` element.  Certain EPrints internal documents such as `indexcodes.txt` and `preview.png` are ignored.

After downloading a complete record from EPrints, this program creates [BagIt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt) bags from the contents of the subdirectory created for the record.  This is done by default, after the documents are downloaded for each record, unless the `-B` option (`/B` on Windows) is given.  Note that creating bags is a destructive operation: it replaces the individual directories of each record with a restructured directory corresponding to the BagIt format.

The final step after creating bags is to create a single-file archive of the bag contents.  By default, this is done in uncompressed [ZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) format.  The option `-f` (or `/f` on Windows) can be used to change the archive format.  If given the value `none`, the bags are not put into an archive file and are instead left as-is.  Other possible values are: `compressed-zip`, `uncompressed-zip`, `compressed-tar`, and `uncompressed-tar`.  The default is `uncompressed-zip` (used if no `-f` option is given).  [ZIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) is the default because it is more widely recognized and supported than [tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)) format, and _uncompressed_ ZIP is used because file corruption is generally more damaging to a compressed archive than an uncompressed one.  Since the main use case for `eprints2bags` is to archive contents for long-term storage, avoiding compression seems safer even though it means the results take up more space.


### Login credentials

Downloading documents usually requires supplying a user login and password to the EPrints server.  By default, this program uses the operating system's keyring/keychain functionality to get a user name and password.  If the information does not exist from a previous run of `eprints2bags`, it will query the user interactively for the user name and password, and unless the `-K` argument (`/K` on Windows) is given, store them in the user's keyring/keychain so that it does not have to ask again in the future.  It is also possible to supply the information directly on the command line using the `-u` and `-p` options (or `/u` and `/p` on Windows), but this is discouraged because it is insecure on multiuser computer systems.

To reset the user name and password (e.g., if a mistake was made the last time and the wrong credentials were stored in the keyring/keychain system), add the `-R` (or `/R` on Windows) command-line argument to a command.  When `eprints2bags` is run with this option, it will query for the user name and password again even if an entry already exists in the keyring or keychain.


### Examples

Running eprints2bags then consists of invoking the program like any other program on your system.  The following is a simple example showing how to get a single record (#85447) from Caltech's [CODA](https://libguides.caltech.edu/CODA) Eprints server (with user name and password blanked out here for security reasons):

```
# eprints2bags -o /tmp/eprints -f 85447 -a https://authors.library.caltech.edu/rest -u XXXXX -p XXXXX

Beginning to process 1 EPrints entry.
Output will be written under directory "/tmp/eprints"

### Additional notes and considerations

Beware that some file systems have limitations on the number of subdirectories that can be created, which directly impacts how many record subdirectories can be created by this program.  In particular, note that Linux ext2 and ext3 file systems are limited to 31,998 subdirectories.  This means you cannot grab more than 32,000 entries at a time from an EPrints server.

It is also noteworthy that hitting a server for tens of thousands of records and documents in rapid succession is likely to draw suspicion from server administrators.  By default, this program inserts a small delay between record fetches (adjustable using the `-d` command-line option), which may be too short in some cases.  Setting the value to 0 is also possible, but might get you blocked or banned from an institution's servers.

‚ù° History
--------

In 2018, [Betsy Coles](https://github.com/betsycoles) wrote a [set of Perl scripts](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/eprints2dpn) and described a workflow for bagging contents from Caltech's Eprints-based [Caltech Collection of Open Digital Archives (CODA)](https://libguides.caltech.edu/CODA) server.  The original code is still available in this repository in the [historical](historical) subdirectory.  In late 2018, Mike Hucka sought to expand the functionality of the original tools and generalize them in anticipation of having to stop using DPN because on 2018-12-04, DPN announced they were shutting down. Thus was born _eprints2bags_.
