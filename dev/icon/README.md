Icon sources for eprints2bags
=============================

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=bag&i=1002779) of a bag used as a logo for this repository was created by [StoneHub](https://thenounproject.com/stonehub/) from the Noun Project.  It is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

I edited the logo in [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com), a native SVG editor for macOS, to add a letter "e" in the middle (using the font named "Carme" provided in Boxy SVG out of the box) and to change the color of everything to the orange used by Caltech in their logo.
